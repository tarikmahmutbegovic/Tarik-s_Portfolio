# Tariks Portfolio
My portfolio of computer science projects relating to data science

# [Project 1: Data Visualization/Analysis of user reviews left on python3 course](https://github.com/tarikmahmutbegovic/UserReviewAnalysis) 
* Utilized python libraries to create an interactive web-application for ease of viewing average user reviews left by over 40,000 students
* Learned data analysis libraries such as pandas and jupyter notebook to select, filter, and aggregate important statistical computations
* Learned data caching from JSON and csv files to import data into statistical charts created from JavaScript

# [Project 2: Volcano Web Application](https://github.com/tarikmahmutbegovic/VolcanoWebApp)
* Created an interactive web application that shows the height and location of all volcanoes in North America 
* Utilized python libraries such as pandas to fetch data from JSON and txt files containing the latitude and longitude of all volcanoes in the country 
* Utilized python libraries such as folium to plot locations on the interactive web application
* Created dynamic color markers for each volcano based on elevation, utilized HTML to create hyperlinks for each volcano

# [Project 3: Book Keeper desktop application](https://github.com/tarikmahmutbegovic/BookKeeper)
* Created an executable desktop application that allows the user to store, update, delete, and search for books that they have read
* Utilized python3 libraries such as tkinter to create the frontend script along with the GUI that allows ease of viewing from the user
* Utilized python3 libraries such as sqlite3 to interact with compatible databases for the storage of user information and the creation of the backend script
